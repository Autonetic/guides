Simple Laravel Hello World

To create a simple "Hello World" web application using Laravel, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up a New Laravel Project**:
   - Use Composer to create a new Laravel project:
     ```
     composer create-project laravel/laravel hello_world
     ```
     Alternatively, you can use the Laravel installer:
     ```
     laravel new helloworld
     ```
     

2. **Configure Routes**:
   - Open the `routes/web.php` file and add a new route:
     ```php
     Route::get('/hello', function () {
         return 'Hello World';
     });
     ```
     This route will display "Hello World" when accessed. 

3. **Create a View** (Optional for simplicity):
   - Create a new Blade view file named `hello.blade.php` in the `resources/views` directory.
   - Add the following content to the view:
     ```html
     <h1>Hello World</h1>
     ```
   - Modify the route to return the view:
     ```php
     Route::get('/hello', function () {
         return view('hello');
     });
     ```
     

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Start the Laravel development server:
     ```
     php artisan serve
     ```
   - Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:8000/hello`.
   - You should see "Hello World" displayed on the page. 

For a more structured approach, you can create a controller and view:

1. **Create a Controller**:
   - Generate a new controller using Artisan:
     ```
     php artisan make:controller HelloController
     ```
   - Edit the `HelloController.php` file and add a method to return the view:
     ```php
     public function hello() {
         return view('helloview');
     }
     ```
   - In the `routes/web.php` file, add the route to map to the controller method:
     ```php
     Route::get('/helloworld', 'HelloController@hello');
     ```
     

2. **Create a View**:
   - Create a new Blade view file named `helloview.blade.php` in the `resources/views` directory.
   - Add the following content to the view:
     ```html
     <h1>Hello World</h1>
     ```
   - Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:8000/helloworld`.
   - You should see "Hello World" displayed on the page. 

These steps will help you set up a simple "Hello World" Laravel application.
