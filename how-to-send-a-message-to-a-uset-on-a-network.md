How To Send A Message via SSH Either Locally Or Over Your Network

To send a message to another Linux PC on a network using SSH, you can use the `write` command or `echo` command piped to SSH. For example, you can use `ssh user@hostname write username message` to send a message to a specific user on the remote machine Alternatively, you can use `echo "message" | ssh user@hostname 'cat > /dev/stdout'` to send a message directly to the terminal of the user logged in on the remote machine

Another method involves using netcat (`nc`), which allows you to send messages between two computers on the same network without encryption. On the receiving computer, you start `nc -l port_number` to listen for incoming messages. On the sending computer, you type `nc ip_address port_number` and then type your message

For sending messages to multiple PCs over a LAN, you can use tools like ClusterSSH or Parallel SSH (PSSH)

If you want to send a message to all users connected to the server via SSH, you can use the `wall` command, which sends a message to all users' terminals

Each of these methods has its own advantages and may be more suitable depending on your specific needs and network setup.
