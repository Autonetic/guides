MariaDB Comments Database

To model a many-to-many relationship between comments and blog posts in a MariaDB database, you can use a join table. This table will connect each comment to multiple blog posts and vice versa. Here is an example of how you can set up the schema:

1. **Blog_Posts Table**: This table stores information about each blog post.
   * **blog_post_id**: Primary key, identifies each blog post uniquely.
   * **title**: The title of the blog post.
   * **content**: The content of the blog post.
   * **author**: The author of the blog post.

2. **Comments Table**: This table stores information about each comment.
   * **comment_id**: Primary key, identifies each comment uniquely.
   * **content**: The content of the comment.
   * **author**: The author of the comment.
   * **created_at**: Timestamp of when the comment was created.

3. **Blog_Posts_Comments Table**: This join table connects blog posts to comments.
   * **blog_post_id**: Foreign key referencing the blog_post_id in the Blog_Posts table.
   * **comment_id**: Foreign key referencing the comment_id in the Comments table.

Here is an example of how you can create these tables in MariaDB:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Blog_Posts (
  blog_post_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE Comments (
  comment_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE Blog_Posts_Comments (
  blog_post_id INT,
  comment_id INT,
  PRIMARY KEY (blog_post_id, comment_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (blog_post_id) REFERENCES Blog_Posts(blog_post_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (comment_id) REFERENCES Comments(comment_id)
);
```

This setup allows each blog post to be associated with multiple comments, and each comment to be associated with multiple blog posts, creating a many-to-many relationship

To query the comments for a specific blog post, you can use a JOIN statement:

```sql
SELECT c.comment_id, c.content, c.author, c.created_at
FROM Comments c
JOIN Blog_Posts_Comments bpc ON c.comment_id = bpc.comment_id
WHERE bpc.blog_post_id = [specific_blog_post_id];
```

This query retrieves all comments associated with a specific blog post by joining the Comments and Blog_Posts_Comments tables and filtering by the blog post ID
